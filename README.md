## Introduction

Welcome to the World Data Analysis project! This repository houses the documentation, SQL queries, and code for a comprehensive analysis of a World dataset using MySQL.  This project serves as a comprehensive analytical tool for a global dataset, featuring detailed information on cities, countries, and their respective populations, and countries' languages. The project presents my skills in MySQL for efficient data querying, sorting, and filtering. 

## Objectives

- Create Word document to document each task.
- Download and import required SQL script to MySQL Workbench.
- Run and create databases
- Execute queries
- Create an EER diagram

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project consists of World countries-related database.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL:** MySQL was the core tool used for data storage, querying, and analysis, allowing us to leverage the power of relational databases.
- **SQL Queries:** A series of SQL queries were designed to extract and manipulate data from the World database.

## Key Insights

The project has resulted in valuable insights into various aspects of World countries, such as countries' cities, capitals, life expectancy, languages, and more.

## Repository Contents

- **SQL Queries:** This section contains SQL queries used for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Documentation:** The documentation provides a detailed explanation of the data analysis process and the insights gained from the project.
- **Data:** Raw and cleaned datasets, if applicable, are stored in this section.


## Example queries

I have written SQL queries to find out information about the countries. 

#### 1) Using count, the number of cities in the USA was presented here:
